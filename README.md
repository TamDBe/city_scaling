This repo contains the resources for performing an analysis on the relation between the growth of city size (population) and the city's land area at the global level. The analysis was performed on the Global Human Settlement's [Urban Centre dataset](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_stat_ucdb2015mt_r2019a.php) containing data of cities from all over the world. The [R script](https://github.com/TamDBe/city_scaling/blob/main/script/density_scaling.R) contains code to create figures, tables, and statistics used for analysis of the data.
