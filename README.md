This repo contains the resources for performing an analysis on the relation between the growth of city size (population) and the city's land area at the global level. The analysis is performed on the [Urban Centre dataset](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_stat_ucdb2015mt_r2019a.php) containing data of cities from all over the world. The [R script](https://github.com/TamDBe/city_scaling/blob/main/script/density_scaling.R) creates figures, tables, and statistics used for analysis.

The data stored in this repo was obtained on Feb 25, 2022.
